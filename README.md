# COVID-19 Data Cleaning and Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook dedicated to cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing COVID-19 data. The notebook applies various data preprocessing techniques to ensure the dataset is clean and structured for insightful analysis. Additionally, it includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to identify trends and patterns in COVID-19 cases.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handling missing and inconsistent data
  - Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns
  - Standardizing column names and data types
  - Filtering out invalid or irrelevant data

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Statistical summary of the dataset
  - Distribution of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and fatalities
  - Identifying trends over time
  - Correlation analysis between different features

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Time-series plots of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths
  - Geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases
  - Heatmaps, bar charts, and histograms to extract insights

## Requirements
To run the notebook in Google Colab, you don't need to install anything locally. However, if running it in Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
### Running in Google Colab
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the following link:  
   **[Open in Google Colab](YOUR_COLAB_LINK_HERE)**
2. Run the notebook cells step by step.
3. If necessary, mount Google Drive to access datasets stored there.

### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-data-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd covid19-data-analysis
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `Covid-19_data_cleaning_and_analysis.ipynb` and execute the cells step by step.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook includes global COVID-19 statistics, such as:
- **Confirmed Cases:** Daily updates on the number of cases reported worldwide
- **Recoveries:** Number of people who have recovered from the virus
- **Fatalities:** Number of deaths attributed to COVID-19
- **Geographic Data:** Country-wise and region-wise case distribution
- **Time-Series Data:** Analysis of how COVID-19 cases evolved over time

## Methodology
1. **Loading the Data:**
   - Importing necessary libraries
   - Reading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Checking for missing values and handling them appropriately
   - Removing or imputing outliers
   - Standardizing column names and formats
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Generating statistical summaries (`df.describe()`, `df.info()`)
   - Finding trends in daily, weekly, and monthly case counts
   - Identifying highly affected regions
   
4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Plotting time-series trends for cases, recoveries, and deaths
   - Visualizing country-wise distribution of cases using bar charts
   - Creating correlation heatmaps to find relationships between features
   
5. **Conclusion & Insights:**
   - Summarizing the key takeaways from the analysis
   - Potential next steps for further research or predictive modeling
